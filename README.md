# Fifty snowflakes for fifty of the largest North American ski resorts. How do they compare?

_Nucleating around a dust particle, each snowflake has six branches. Each branch grows independently and its length encodes one of the key figures describing a ski resort: number of trails, average annual snowfall, vertical drop, peak elevation, adult weekend lift ticket, and number of lifts. The number of trails is used to select, and sort, the fifty largest ski resorts._

The raw data was processed, transformed, and plotted in R; Inkscape was then used to combine the elements.

## Data

The dataset can be found on the Wikipedia [Comparison of North American ski resorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_North_American_ski_resorts) page and is released under a [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license. 

## Code

Run master.R to reproduce the visualization. The small multiples, legend and map visualizations are saved separately as .svg and .PDF in /plots.

## Poster

The legend, map, small multiples, description and title were then put together in Inkscape.
