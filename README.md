# Fifty snowflakes for fifty of the largest North American ski resorts. How do they compare?

_Nucleating around a dust particle, each snowflake has six branches. Each branch grows independently and its length encodes one of the key figures describing a ski resort: number of trails, average annual snowfall, vertical drop, peak elevation, adult weekend lift ticket, and number of lifts. The number of trails is used to select, and sort, the fifty largest ski resorts._
